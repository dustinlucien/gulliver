    <h3>Why wait in line at a local drug store or copy center?</h3>
    <p>
      Don't endure long lines or terrible photos that you have to live with
      for 10 years? There's nothing wrong with getting your passport or visa
      photos printed at any of the copy centers, drug stores and general
      stores around town, but it's not the only option either.
    </p>
    <h3>Babies or small children?</h3>
    <p>
      Breaking into a cold sweat trying to imagine convincing your little ones
      to sit still at the local copy center long enough for the always-patient
      employee behind the counter to shoot a useful passport photo? Take the
      picture yourself, on your schedule, in the comfort of your own home. And
      give yourself the luxury of taking a few extra just in case junior won't sit
      still for the first one.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do all the work yourself?</h3>
    <p>
      Why use other websites where they actually make <strong>you</strong> do
      the work of properly laying out your images. We only ask you to take the
      picture and upload. We don’t ask you to use other website’s software to
      frame your head. We do all the work so you don’t have to.
    </p>
    <h3>We don't want you to risk it</h3>
    <p>
      Take the photo yourself, following <%= link_to "our instructions",

      they'll pass muster, or your money back.
